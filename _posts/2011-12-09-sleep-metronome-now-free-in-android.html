A few weeks ago I <a href="http://blog.hjfreyer.com/2011/11/slowing-metronome.html">posted</a> about a little Python
script I wrote to help me get to sleep. I'm pleased to say that I've been using it every night since and it's been
working great for
me.<br /><br />After a couple weeks of setting up my laptop next to me before bed, I decided that it'd be way better as an Android app, so I wrote it up. Now you too can experience the clicking sensations:&nbsp;<a

	Metronome</a><br />

				<div>I was very impressed with how pleasant the experience of writing an app was. I went from having not
					touched a single line of Android code to having a published app in the space of 24 hours. A++ would
					code again.</div>
