This is all very well documented on the web already, but rather than write the same email over and over to friends, I
figured I'd post it here.<br /><br />
<h2>Enable Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
<div>With two-factor authentication, the first time you log into your account from a new computer, the site you're
	logging into sends you a text message with a code, and you have to enter that code. This makes it so you need to
	have your cell phone on you to authorize a new computer (and once every month or so thereafter to refresh it), and
	so therefore a hacker needs both your password <i>and </i>your cell phone to get at your account. This is one of
	those things which is a minor annoyance for a user, but is a <i>major </i>annoyance for a hacker. It puts you in a
	whole different ball game from a security standpoint.</div>

		<h2>Use phrase-based passwords</h2>
        <div><b>Edit in 2020:</b> I made a site for this purpose: <a href="https://classypasswords.com">classypasswords.com</a>
        <br/>
		<div>First read this xkcd:&nbsp;<a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">https://xkcd.com/936/</a></div>
		<div>Bottom line is, your password is way less secure than you think it is, but you can easily make a password
			which is, in fact, very string.</div>
		<div>This site is great for generating short phrases which make good passwords:&nbsp;<a

			<div>Go forth, and be safe!</div>
