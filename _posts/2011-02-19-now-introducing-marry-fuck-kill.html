My&nbsp;roommate, <a href="http://michaelkelly.org/">Michael James Kelly</a>&nbsp;and I have produced a new Interactive
App for the Interwebs: <a href="http://marryfuckkill.com/">Marry Fuck
	Kill</a>!<br /><br />The parlor game upon which it is based is as old as time itself: given three "things", you must choose one to marry, one to fuck, and one to kill. Now, for the first time ever, you can pose these dilemmas to users the world over, and waste countless hours voting on MFKs from others as well!<br /><br />Check it out:
