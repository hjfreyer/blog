<i>I must not use Perl.<br />Perl is the mind-killer.<br />Perl is the little-death that brings total obliteration.<br />I will face my script.<br />I will permit it to run over me and through me.<br />And when it has finished I will turn on the debugger to trace its stack.<br />Where the Perl has gone there will be nothing.<br />Only I will remain.<br /></i><br /><i><small>Blatantly stolen from Frank Herbert's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litany_against_fear">Litany Against Fear</a>.</small></i>
