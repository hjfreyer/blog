A few nights ago I was wired and restless and couldn't sleep, and I wondered if there was something I could listen to
that would help me chill out. I searched around the Android app store for sleep-related apps, but most of them just
played noises of crickets or rain or new age music and it wasn't helping. I wanted something simple and rhythmic I could
focus on. Perhaps a
metronome.<br /><br />But what tempo? Too fast and it'd keep me wired. Too slow and I'd be impatient and annoyed. So I had an idea: how about a metronome that slows down gradually over a long time period?<br /><br />I eventually got to sleep, but I kept playing with the idea. Yesterday I decided to write it up. I grabbed my notebook and used the power of calculus to find a formula for the frequency of the metronome over time. The key condition was that I wanted the period between ticks to get longer by a fixed N% with each tick, so the change would be as uniform as possible.<br /><br />Here's the formula for the frequency at time t, given that the metronome starts with frequency<span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;S and ends with frequency E after D seconds:</span><br /><span style="background-color: transparent;"><br /></span><br />

</div>
<br />So I whipped up a little script using pygame and when going to sleep last night I set it to tick for 15 minutes, starting at 90 beats per minute, ending at 12 bpm. I don't remember when it stopped, so that's a good sign! Try it out and let me know if it works!<br /><br /><a
