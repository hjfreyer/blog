I've enjoyed maintaining&nbsp;<a href="http://pentris.net/">Pentris</a>&nbsp;over the past few years since I first wrote
it. It's fun and it has a small following; it gets played a couple thousand times a month, has a bit over 50 unique
visitors every day, and has made me about $45 in advertising revenue in 3 years (yeah, I haven't been trying that hard
on this front). The fact that people keep coming back to play keeps me coming back to improve it now and then, and
recently I decided that it deserves its own domain.<div><br /></div>
	<div>I'm happy to announce that <a href="http://www.pentris.net/">http://www.pentris.net</a> is the now the official
		place to fulfill all your Pentris-related needs! It even has a cool new logo:</div>
	<div><br /></div>

			<div>Previously, Pentris was hosted on <a href="http://hjfreyer.com/">hjfreyer.com</a>, which ran on <a
					href="http://sites.google.com/">Google Sites</a>. Sites is pretty acceptable for hosting a simple
				personal page, but unfortunately I couldn't stay on Sites if I wanted to make a smooth transition from
				<a href="http://hjfreyer.com/pentris">hjfreyer.com/pentris</a> to <a
					href="http://pentris.net/">pentris.net</a> (Sites doesn't let you do 301 redirects). I had to remake
				my site from scratch and host it <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">elsewhere</a>. I'm glad I
				did, though; I turned a bland site with four sparse pages into a single page which looks pretty nice.
				Compare <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/hjfreyer.com/www/">the old</a> with <a
					href="http://hjfreyer.com/"><span id="goog_313978708"></span>the
					new<span id="goog_313978709"></span></a>.</div>
			<div><br /></div>
				<div>Eagle-eyed readers may notice that I completely ripped off the design of <a
						href="http://about.me/">about.me</a> (<a href="http://about.me/gregphipps">e.g.</a>). I did so
					because it's a good design. Show me an artist who isn't a thief, and I'll show you a web programmer
					who isn't lazy.</div>
				<div><br /></div>
					<div>Check out the new sites and <a href="mailto:yt@hjfreyer.com">let me know</a> if either of them
						cause you any trouble.</div>
